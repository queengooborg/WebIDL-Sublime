# WebIDL Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

This package provides WebIDL syntax highlighting based upon the [W3C Spec](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/) for Sublime Text, designed to provide as much functionality as possible, including symbol detection and a little bit of syntax validation.  (Note that this package is not designed to support Microsoft's IDL format -- check out [andik's package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/IDL-Syntax) for that).

## Installation

### Via Package Control

- Press ⇧⌘P / Ctrl+Shift+P
- Type or select `Package Control: Install Package`
- Type or select `WebIDL`

## Issues?

Please, please, do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns, whether opening a [pull request](https://github.com/queengooborg/WebIDL-Sublime/issues) or reaching out to me on my [socials](https://www.queengoob.org)!  This is my first ever Sublime Text plugin, and in my 10+ years of development experience, I've learned that there's always something to learn, always something to improve.
