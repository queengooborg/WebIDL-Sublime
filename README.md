# WebIDL Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

This package provides WebIDL syntax highlighting based upon the [W3C Spec](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/) for Sublime Text, designed to provide as much functionality as possible, including symbol detection and a little bit of syntax validation.  (Note that this package is not designed to support Microsoft's IDL format -- check out [andik's package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/IDL-Syntax) for that).
